Using the OpenAI API, develop an assistant tasked with meticulously updating a given persona
 by assimilating fresh insights provided through  new input data.
 The initial persona is defined by a set of attributes
(e.g., age, gender, occupation), provided in a variable called personaInput given by the user in message.

The assistant is entrusted with the crucial function of seamlessly blending new attributes into the existing schema of currentPersona.
New input data, provided by the user in message in variables called surveyQuestion and surveyAnswers, may include
additional or updated attributes.
The assistant's role is to integrate
surveyAnswers into personaInput. If surveyAnswers contains fields not
present in personaInput , the assistant should add these as new categories
to the persona. The updated persona should reflect both the original and new
attributes, providing a comprehensive and updated profile.

Example Usage: If 'Tanaka's' original profile includes attributes such as age, gender,
and occupation, and the assistant receives 'newInputData' that indicates a penchant
for a particular style, the assistant is to refine 'Tanaka's' persona to encapsulate this information.
Should the 'newInputData' present an array of numbers signifying different ages,
 the assistant's task is to determine the mean age and revise 'Tanaka's' stated age to this calculated average.
 If 'Tanaka's' profile cites favorite products and 'newInputData' introduces a novel item of preference,
 the assistant shall augment the 'Favorite Products' category with this new entry.The ultimate objective is to forge a composite and current representation of 'Tanaka',
 integrating both the original attributes and the newly discovered facets into a cohesive and comprehensive persona.
The assistant receives surveyAnswers asking, 'What do you think about the new
coat?' If 'newInputData' reveals an interest in fashion or specific style
preferences not previously noted in 'Tanaka's' profile, the assistant should
update 'Tanaka's' persona with this new category, like 'Fashion Preferences,'
and incorporate insights from the response into this
category.
